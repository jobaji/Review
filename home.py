    # FAQ Section
    with st.expander("FAQ"):
        st.write("""
        **Q: What is Sentiment Analysis?**  
        A: Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind words. It helps classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

        **Q: How accurate is this app?**  
        A: The accuracy depends on the machine learning model and dataset used for training. For best results, the model was trained on a diverse dataset of movie reviews.

        **Q: What technologies power this app?**  
        A: This app uses a combination of Python libraries such as Streamlit for the interface, TextBlob for text analysis, and a Random Forest machine learning model for sentiment classification.

        **Q: Can this app analyze reviews in other languages?**  
        A: Currently, the app is optimized for English reviews. For non-English text, translation tools can be integrated in the future.

        **Q: What are Polarity and Subjectivity?**  
        A:  
        - **Polarity** measures how positive or negative a review is, with values ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).  
        - **Subjectivity** measures how opinionated the text is, with values ranging from 0 (factual) to 1 (opinion-based).

        **Q: Can I analyze multiple reviews at once?**  
        A: Currently, this app supports one review at a time. However, batch analysis can be added in the future for multiple reviews.

        **Q: Is my data secure?**  
        A: Yes, all reviews are processed locally and are not stored or shared with third parties.

        **Q: How can I contribute to this project?**  
        A: You can reach out to the creators for collaboration or suggestions. Your feedback is always welcome to improve the app!

        **Q: Why do I get "neutral" results sometimes?**  
        A: Neutral results occur when the text contains a mix of positive and negative words or lacks strong emotional tones.

        **Q: Can this app handle sarcasm or context?**  
        A: Sarcasm and complex context are challenging for most sentiment analysis models. While the app does its best, it might misclassify such cases.

        **Q: What's next for this app?**  
        A: Future updates may include support for additional languages, improved visualizations, integration with APIs (like movie databases), and batch review analysis.
